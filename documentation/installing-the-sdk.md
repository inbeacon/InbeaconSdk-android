## Integrating inBeacon in an Android Studio project

### JCenter (recommended)

Add JCenter to your build file's list of repositories:

```groovy
    repositories {
        jcenter()
        ..
    }
```

Now include:    

```groovy
dependencies {
	compile('com.inbeacon:android.sdk:2.+@aar'){ transitive = true }
}
```
to your gradle dependencies. See bintray for details: [https://bintray.com/inbeacon/maven/android.sdk/view](https://bintray.com/inbeacon/maven/android.sdk/view)

You can use a dynamic version (2.+) to get the latest 2.x version of the SDK (recommended) 
>Don't forget transitive = true. Because we specify @aar, transitive no longer defaults to true

#### Version conflicts
The inbeacon SDK has dependencies on the following libraries and versions:

```
   compile 'com.android.support:support-v4:27.1.1'
   compile 'org.altbeacon:android-beacon-library:2.13.1'      
   compile 'com.google.code.gson:gson:2.8.2'
   compile 'com.squareup.okhttp3:okhttp:3.10.0'
   compile 'com.squareup.okhttp3:logging-interceptor:3.10.0'
   compile 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-location:11.8.0'
   compile 'com.google.dagger:dagger:2.15'

```

If your application depends on different versions, you might be able to override the SDK versions. To do that, include a resolutionStrategy.force statement to force gradle to use a specific version in your main build.gradle file. As an example, if you want to force using version 3.6.0 of okhttp you might use the following statement:

```

allprojects {
    repositories {
        jcenter()
        maven {
            url "https://maven.google.com"
        }
    }
    configurations.all {
        // force using a specific version of a dependency
        resolutionStrategy.force 'com.squareup.okhttp3:okhttp:3.6.0'
    }
}
```
Run the gradle task ```gradle app:dependencies``` to get information about all versions that are used in your app, and you'll see that in this case okhttp 3.6.0 is used:

```
\--- com.inbeacon:android.sdk:2.+ -> 2.1.8
     +--- com.android.support:support-v4:25.4.0 (*)
     +--- org.altbeacon:android-beacon-library:2.11
     +--- com.google.code.gson:gson:2.8.1
     +--- com.squareup.okhttp3:okhttp:3.10.0 -> 3.6.0 (*)
```

> See the provided example app for more information.

### Proguard rules

The SDK proguard rules are automatically merged into your project.

### Binary release 

If you donâ€™t want to use the JCenter repository, you can download and include all files manually from the [repository](https://github.com/inbeacon/InbeaconSdk-android).

To include the .aar in your android studio project, copy the aar file to the app/libs directory and include:

```groovy
repositories {
   flatDir {
       dirs 'libs'
   }
}

compile 'com.android.support:support-v4:27.1.1'         
compile 'org.altbeacon:android-beacon-library:2.13.1'  
compile 'com.google.code.gson:gson:2.8.2'
compile 'com.squareup.okhttp3:okhttp:3.10.0'
compile 'com.squareup.okhttp3:logging-interceptor:3.10.0'
compile 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-location:11.8.0'
compile(name:'android.sdk-release', ext:'aar')
```

In this case you need to specify some dependencies by hand.

Now you are set to go. Try to compile and see that your app is still working. Now you need to add some code to start the inBeacon SDK.
